This page is for graphs showing how lifeguard can scale.

This graph shows 164 units of work being submitted and how lifeguard reacts. It was told to scale, adding 1 server at a time. The queueScaleFactor was set to 50. The interesting line is the green one which shows when the servers first started reporting status (they are ready to work).

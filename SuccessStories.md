_Lifeguard in the real world._

Some people who are using lifeguard are going public about it. Some are sharing the services they've written. To help highlight these installations and contributions, we'll start by listing them here! The code contributions will be checked into SVN under the contrib directory.

This company produces a very cool video capture device which you should check out on their web site; http://www.vholdr.com/ They have been using lifeguard in production since December 2007 to manage their video transcoding servers. For more details, see the AWS blog article; http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/01/vholdr---wearab.html

Furthermore, Noah from VholdR has sent their VideoConversionService which is a souped up version of the sample TranscodingService I wrote. They use ffmpeg to not only transcode video for their site but grab the thumbnail frame as well.
